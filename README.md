A Bash script I wrote for my Operating Systems class that helps users manage files that are older than a specified date. After locating the relevant files, it allows users to choose which ones they want to manage. The script provides several operations, including moving files either to a local directory or a GitHub repository, deleting files, renaming files, and allowing for file edits. Additionally, it includes features for archiving files, searching within file contents, and encrypting them for secure storage. The scriptâ€™s interactive interface guides users through these operations.
